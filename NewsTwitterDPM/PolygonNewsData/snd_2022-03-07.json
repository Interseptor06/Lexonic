of Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond Inc (NASDAQ: BBBY) were surging Monday on the heels of news that Ryan Cohen took a stake in the company and is pushing for changes. Here’s a look at how Cohen’s biggest e-commerce bets have fared.\nWhat Happened: It was announced over the weekend that Cohen holds a 9.8% stake in retailer Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond. Cohen and his investment firm RC Ventures are a top five shareholder in the company.\nA letter sent to the Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond Board of Directors was viewed by The Wall Street Journal and is said to call for a push to streamline the company’s strategy and consider strategic alternatives like spinning off or selling the company’s Buybuy Baby brand.\nThe letter from Cohen comes as Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond laid out a turnaround plan that included reducing the number of items in stores and the launch of private label brands.\nCohen said that the spinoff of Buybuy Baby could be worth several billon dollars.\nIn the letter, Cohen said he is not in a position to join the board of Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond given his focus on GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME). Cohen could nominate candidates for the board, with a nomination window open now and closing in mid-March.\nThe retailer issued a statement Monday morning about Cohen’s letter.\n“Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond’s Board and management team maintain a consistent dialogue with our shareholders and, while we have had no prior contact with RC ...","keywords":["News","Top Stories","Movers","Trading Ideas"]},{"id":"0x5gtFYVMje7Iy4cTVFX2KE1prwxPJiAyR7vADgkJec","publisher":{"name":"Zacks Investment Research","homepage_url":"https://www.zacks.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"},"title":"Do Options Traders Know Something About BCE (BCE) Stock We Don't?","author":"Zacks Equity Research","published_utc":"2022-03-07T16:38:00Z","article_url":"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1878589/do-options-traders-know-something-about-bce-bce-stock-we-dont","tickers":["BCE"],"amp_url":"https://www.zacks.com/amp/stock/news/1878589/do-options-traders-know-something-about-bce-bce-stock-we-dont","image_url":"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/aa/338.jpg","description":"Investors need to pay close attention to BCE (BCE) stock based on the movements in the options market lately."},{"id":"_30G6Hrv1fPFb6iqprNKia9jq32guqwPx2OKSzh47-4","publisher":{"name":"Benzinga","homepage_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"},"title":"Analysis: Why Is Disney Releasing 'Turning Red' In Just One Hollywood Movie Theater?","author":"Phil Hall","published_utc":"2022-03-07T16:36:06Z","article_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/03/26020857/analysis-why-is-disney-releasing-turning-red-in-just-one-hollywood-movie-theater","tickers":["AMZN","DIS"],"amp_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/26020857","image_url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/turning_red_1.jpg","description":"On March 11, Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) will be releasing the latest Pixar animated feature “Turning Red” on its Disney+ streaming service. This marks the third consecutive Pixar production that was steered away from theatrical release and straight to a streaming premiere.\nHowever, the company has arranged for a one-week theatrical release for “Turning Red” at Hollywood’s El Capitan Theatre, beginning March 11. Why is Disney dropping “Turning Red” into a single theater rather than providing it with a nationwide release?\nThe Reasoning: In order for a feature film to be eligible for the Academy Awards, it needs to have been given at least a one-week theatrical engagement in a Los Angeles-area cinema. It doesn’t matter if the film doesn't play in any other market, as long as that minimum requirement is met.\nOther film award-giving entities including the Golden Globes, the film industry’s

(the “Company”) received notice from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel that a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) had granted the Company’s request to continue its listing on Nasdaq through April 26, 2022 (the “Extended Date”). As previously disclosed, in December 2021, the Company attended a hearing before the Panel, at which it presented its plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company must complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement; and demonstrate compliance with all initial listing standards required by the Nasdaq. Following the hearing, and as disclosed on January 5, 2022, the Panel granted the Company’s request for an extension to regain compliance by the original March 14, 2022 (the “Original Extended Date”). On February 28, 2022, the Company submitted a request for additional extension as a result of the need for additional time to prepare and include the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 for the Company and SolarMax in the S-4, which request was granted by the Panel on March 3, 2022. The Panel’s decision is subject to certain conditions, including that the Company will have completed its previously announced proposed business combination (the “Business Combination”) with SolarMax Technology, Inc. (“SolarMax”) on or before April 26, 2022, the Extended Date, and that the combined company will have demonstrated compliance with all applicable requirements for initial listing on Nasdaq. The Panel stated that April 26, 2022 represents the full extent of the Panel’s discretion to grant continued listing while the Company is non-compliant. As a result, if the merger is not completed and the Company does not demonstrate compliance with the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements by April 26, 2022, the Panel will issue a final delist determination and the Company will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq.","keywords":["Press releases"]},{"id":"3v7AUaMwIerCZJqnedQWw0JIXpjN7IWza4iFgAAcD6c","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"Three Valley Copper Commences Papomono Block Caving Operations","author":"Three Valley Copper Corp.","published_utc":"2022-03-07T12:00:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/07/2397769/0/en/Three-Valley-Copper-Commences-Papomono-Block-Caving-Operations.html","tickers":["TVC"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/07/2397769/0/en/Three-Valley-Copper-Commences-Papomono-Block-Caving-Operations.html","image_url":"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/88e84d48-f585-4759-9ed7-53c08f0462d7?size=1","description":"TORONTO, March  07, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (TSXV: TVC) (OTCQB: TVCCF) Three Valley Copper Corp.
