This content is for informational purposes only and not intended to be investing advice.\n(Tuesday Market Open) Stocks look to bounce back from Monday’s selloff, hoping that Monday was a “wash out” day—a day where investors are able to unload their riskier assets to focus on blue chip and value. However, the Cboe Market Volatility Index (VIX) is higher on Tuesday morning, suggesting investor fear is still high. Oil prices are higher once again, trading more than 2% higher on a volatile overnight session.\nOn the bright side, investors appear to be getting help overseas as European markets were trading higher. The STOXX Europe 600 was 0.81% higher. The German DAX was rallying 1.51%. And the French CAC 40 was up 1.91%.\nThe Asian-Pacific markets are looking a little less bright. The Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.71%; the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index dropped 1.39%, and the Shanghai Index tumbled 2.35%.  \nThe Good, Bad, \u0026 Ugly\nSome of the market’s old reliable stocks fell hard on Monday. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is testing its January lows after falling 5.62% on Monday. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) also fell 4.28% near its support level around 2,500. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is also near support after falling 2.37%. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is in the same boat near support after selling off 3.78%. These companies could be the hope that the bulls need. If they’re able to hold support, stocks could get the bounce they need because of the combined market cap of these companies in the S\u0026P 500.\nWhile big-tech could act as an anchor for the S\u0026P 500, banking appears to be a hole in the boat. The PHLX KBW Bank Index fell 4.62% on Monday. Additionally, financials are the second largest sector in the Russell 2000 (RUT), which helped the small-cap index fall 2.48% on Monday.\nBanks were hit hard by credit card companies ending services in Russia. Visa (NYSE: V) fell 4.79%, Mastercard (NYSE: MA) dropped 5.39%, and American Express (NYSE: AXP) tumbled 7.99%. Falling yields are also pulling the banking sector lower because they’re shrinking the spread between lending and saving. For a couple months, all anyone could talk about was the Fed and next week’s rate decision, but now that story has faded into the background.\nOil Issues\nThe S\u0026P 500 (SPX) broke the 4,300 support level that had been in place since July of 2021 and tested a few times after WTI crude oil futures spiked over the weekend—trading as high as $130 per barrel—as an increasing number of companies are choosing not to buy Russian oil. However, oil prices retreated to $120.10, which was still 3.8% higher than the closing price on Friday.\nRising oil prices helped the energy sector to be one of two sectors in the green on Monday. Investors appeared to favor the defensive nature of utilities overall because the Utilities Select Sector Index rose 1.31%. Treasuries also benefited from investors searching for safe havens because the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) fell 1.57%. Bond prices were even most of the day, but they found a lot of interest as the day wore on and investors started looking for safety. A third safe haven appeared to be ...Full story available on

(TSX-V: EVER, OTC: EVGUF, WKN: A2PTHZ) (“Evergold” or the “Company”) is pleased to report excellent progress in recent months toward drilling the road-accessible Rockland property, located in the resurgent Walker Lane trend of western Nevada. The west side of the property (“Rockland West”) hosts the historical small-scale Rockland Mine, from which an estimated 50,000 ounces of gold-silver grading as high as 2.8 ounces per ton gold equivalent (96 g/t AuEq) was produced more than a century ago from high-grade epithermal-style veins, commonly encompassed by broad halos of lower-grade stockworks and breccia. The east side of the property (“Rockland East”) hosts a deeper zone of mineralization, more or less blind to surface and also epithermal in style, first discovered in 1989 and drilled to date along some 800 metres of strike. Historical drilling on the Rockland East zone returned highly encouraging results with all holes achieving drill intercepts, including, for example, 59.4 metres of 1.09 g/t Au encompassing 3.1 metres of 19.80 g/t Au in Romarco hole PG-36C (2008). As at the Rockland Mine area, many of the Rockland East holes bottomed in gold mineralization. Both areas of the property offer excellent resource definition potential and considerable exploration upside, to which end the Company has been methodically exploring and advancing drill targets at the Rockland project in preparation for a potential drill program in 2022.","keywords":["Product / Services Announcement"]},{"id":"81o97ZWtY9vLi-kQTXzApn6DVq0JDMFCgo0YHIwYugM","publisher":{"name":"Zacks Investment Research","homepage_url":"https://www.zacks.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"},"title":"Solar \u0026 Storage to Lead US New Electricity Generation Capacity","author":"Zacks Equity Research","published_utc":"2022-03-08T15:39:00Z","article_url":"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1879122/solar-storage-to-lead-us-new-electricity-generation-capacity","tickers":["SPWR","ENPH","SEDG"],"amp_url":"https://www.zacks.com/amp/stock/news/1879122/solar-storage-to-lead-us-new-electricity-generation-capacity","image_url":"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/16/1973.jpg","description":"Solar and battery storage capacities to be added to the U.S. power grid in the next two years are projected to be 51 GW.

This content is for informational purposes only and not intended to be investing advice.\n\n(Monday Market Close) The S\u0026P 500 (SPX) broke the 4,300 support level that had been in place since July 2021 and tested it a few times after WTI crude oil futures spiked over the weekend—trading as high as $130 per barrel—as an increasing number of companies are choosing not to buy Russian oil. However, oil prices retreated to $120.10, which was still 3.8% higher than the closing price on Friday.\nRising oil prices helped the energy sector to be one of two sectors in the green on Monday. Investors appeared to favor the defensive nature of utilities overall because the Utilities Select Sector Index rose 1.31%. Treasuries also benefited from investors searching for safe havens because the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) fell 1.57%. A third safe haven appeared to be gold. Gold futures rallied 1.81%, moving back above $2,000 and returning to August 2020 highs.\nFear and uncertainty continue to rise, causing the Cboe Market Volatility Index (VIX) to rise more than 11%. Fear is high enough that initial public offerings (IPOs) are disappearing. January had a record number of cancellations at 22. Currently, there are no IPOs listed on the Nasdaq IPO Calendar for any American exchange in March or going forward.\nCommodity Conundrum\nOil was not the only petroleum product to spike. RBOB gasoline futures rallied more than 10% over the weekend but gave back most of its gains and closed just 1.17% higher on the day. Heating oil futures closed 4.82% higher despite reaching nearly 13% higher Sunday evening.\nThe reasons for the spikes are that many private companies are refusing to buy Russian oil and the United States and European allies are considering bans on Russian commodities, according to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Previously, these groups have avoided bans on Russian commodities because of how these embargos could hurt consumers already struggling under the weight of pandemic-related inflation.\nEmbargos on oil could be quite expensive, and it’s causing some analysts to change their projections.
