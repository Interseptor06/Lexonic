(Nasdaq: TCDA), a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of its investigational drug candidate, veverimer, a non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer designed to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, announced today an update on the anticipated date for top-line data from the VALOR-CKD trial based on the ongoing events in Ukraine. Approximately fifteen percent (15%) of the patients randomized in VALOR-CKD are from Ukraine. Given the uncertainty around future participation of Ukrainian subjects in the trial and the potential challenges to collecting and monitoring data from Ukrainian sites, top-line data from the VALOR-CKD trial is now anticipated early in the fourth quarter of 2022, versus Tricida’s previous guidance of the third quarter of 2022. The revised guidance is based on Tricida’s evaluation of the current situation in Ukraine which is dynamic. Its estimates may change as events in Ukraine evolve.

crude oil prices have surged to 11-year highs above $108 per barrel in March in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The geopolitical instability has rattled financial markets, but the energy sector is soaring.\nOn Wednesday, OPEC and its partners agreed to stick to a previous plan to increase oil output slowly in April, suggesting elevated oil prices may be here to stay for the time being.

Analyst Doug Leggate says Exxon has come a long way from where it was six months ago, when some analysts were calling for a dividend cut. Leggate says Exxon can cover its capex and dividends at a crude oil price of $41/bbl, and he believes Exxon's break-even oil price will be $10 below that level by 2028. Incredibly, Leggate says Exxon is positioned to potentially buy back 30% of its stock by that time.\nBank of America has a Buy rating and $110 price target for XOM stock.\nRelated Link: 7 Dividend Growth Stocks That Analysts Love \nChevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX)\nFollowing ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","keywords":["Long Ideas","Analyst Color","Price Target","Commodities","Markets","Analyst Ratings","Trading Ideas"]},{"id":"AhThbPWAKG9U3z9PoDr2C9Ka35emstN8ijktQCjmIgk","publisher":{"name":"Benzinga","homepage_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"},"title":"Analysts Cut Federal Signal Price Target Post Q4 Results","author":"Akanksha Bakshi","published_utc":"2022-03-02T18:26:53Z","article_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/03/25944187/analysts-cut-federal-signal-price-target-post-q4-results","tickers":["FSS"],"amp_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/25944187","image_url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/industrial_pic_1938.jpg","description":"KeyBanc analyst Steve Barger lowered the price target on Federal Signal Corp (NYSE: FSS) to $48 (an upside of 37.5%) from $55 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares.\nThe analyst mentions the shares declined following the company’s Q4 results and 2022 guidance.

Canton, Ohio-based Hall of Fame Resort \u0026 Entertainment Co (NASDAQ: HOFV) is on a mission to offer the best of multiple worlds under a single banner: sports, hospitality, retail, entertainment and digital assets are part of the company’s operations and goals.\nPresident and CEO Michael Crawford spoke with Benzinga on what his company has achieved and what it plans to accomplish in the coming months.\nQ: Your company has some short-term debt coming due. What is your long-term plan for addressing the short-term debt?\nMichael Crawford: We've always been upfront with our investors on every call that I've had in terms of earnings and addressing the balance sheet. Making sure the company was structured for success in the long term has always been a priority for us. COVID had an impact on the commercial lending environments, but thankfully, we've had success there as well.\nWe knew we had about $45 million of near-term debt this year that we needed to address. We've partnered with and put a package together with support from our largest shareholder, Industrial Realty Group (IRG). They are taking out one piece of debt that was due March 1 — a $7.4 million remaining piece of a loan we took out two years ago with a group called Aquarian that was originally $40 million. We paid all of that down to the remaining amount I just referenced and IRG is now going to pay off that remaining amount, take their place of Aquarian and extend that out for over two years.\nThe second piece to this is IRG themselves had a couple of different lending pieces to the company over the last few years, one of which was carrying a small part of the Hilton DoubleTree hotel that we purchased in downtown Canton. They had a $7 million loan there that was due in December 2021. But we had already extended the maturity of that date. We've now restructured that as part of this package to extend for another two-plus years, as well.\nThe third piece was a loan that they had provided to us to bridge us to get to the commercial lending that Erie Bank had financed for us recently, a $22 million commercial loan for our Constellation Center for Excellence. That piece was roughly $8 million. They've agreed to take that ...","keywords":["News","Penny Stocks","Entertainment","Travel","Sports","Exclusives","Interview","General","Real Estate"]},{"id":"DFrSHKhUfmde-Pg9TGqoCe88Amb57ddv_MM2ATIntto","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"Holding(s) in Company","author":"Admiral Group PLC","published_utc":"2022-03-02T16:40:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/02/2395636/0/en/Holding-s-in-Company.html","tickers":["ADM"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/02/2395636/0/en/Holding-s-in-Company.html","image_url":"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/48e9f1df-bd5d-4ec3-89b2-a42ce008892f?size=1","description":"TR-1: Standard form for notification of major holdings","keywords":["Other News","European Regulatory News"]},{"id":"kcQFaAH4oa6NuAMNCGElowohomwk-6-ix3otKn5vdZ8","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"Sorrento Announces COVISHIELD (STI-9199) Antibody Nasal Drops Prevent Productive SARS-CoV-2 Infections When Given 24 Hours Prior to Virus Exposure","author":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.","published_utc":"2022-03-02T16:37:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/02/2395633/0/en/Sorrento-Announces-COVISHIELD-STI-9199-Antibody-Nasal-Drops-Prevent-Productive-SARS-CoV-2-Infections-When-Given-24-Hours-Prior-to-Virus-Exposure.html","tickers":["SRNE"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/02/2395633/0/en/Sorrento-Announces-COVISHIELD-STI-9199-Antibody-Nasal-Drops-Prevent-Productive-SARS-CoV-2-Infections-When-Given-24-Hours-Prior-to-Virus-Exposure.html","image_url":"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/0111f4df-8430-4285-9ae5-b11617628ee9?size=1","description":"SAN DIEGO, March  02, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, \"Sorrento\") today announced that new preclinical results demonstrate that pretreating an animal with intranasal neutralizing antibody (STI-9199) twenty-four (24) hours prior to being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus prevents productive infection in the treated animals. These data suggest that an individual who is at high risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus could potentially be protected by taking STI-9199 nasal neutralizing antibody. For example, if a member of a household becomes infected, the others in the house could be treated with intranasal STI-9199 to potentially prevent them from being infected. This prevention could work in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals but needs to be confirmed in clinical studies. Other potential use cases for this intranasal STI-9199 include pretreatment of front-line healthcare workers, individuals in long-term care facilities or students in schools, where treatment could potentially provide blanket coverage. In addition, travelers on a plane could be pre-treated, which would potentially allow for air and ocean cruise travel with added protection when mask-wearing is not required.","keywords":["Health","Product / Services Announcement"]},{"id":"73NoW79T5jGg5mW4FZkXi1h8EmNSUxlZihn6ubcaqFM","publisher":{"name":"Quartz","homepage_url":"https://qz.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/quartz.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/quartz.ico"},"title":"Ford is splitting up its electric and gas-powered vehicle businesses","author":"Courtney Vinopal","published_utc":"2022-03-02T16:35:19Z","article_url":"https://qz.com/2136508/ford-will-separate-its-ev-and-gas-powered-car-businesses/","tickers":["F","GM","TSLA"],"amp_url":"https://qz.com/2136508/ford-will-separate-its-ev-and-gas-powered-car-businesses/amp/","image_url":"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-02T002019Z_1816801910_RC20US9J7O4C_RTRMADP_3_FORD-MOTOR-REORGANISATION-e1646234970299.jpg?quality=75\u0026strip=all\u0026w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026crop=1","description":"\"Is this about winning? 100%,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said. “We want to beat the old players.

Beasley, the chairman of Tennessee’s Republican Party; Robert Crants, a real estate executive; and T. Don Hutto, the deputy director of the Virginia Department of Corrections who was also president-elect of the American Correctional Association. The company’s initial backers included the Tennessee Valley Authority, Vanderbilt University Law School and Jack C. Massey, co-founder of the HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE: HCA).\nThe company made history in 1983 when it received a contract to design, build, finance and operate a correctional facility for the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This was the first time a privately owned prison company received a federal contract. The company had its initial public offering in October 2016 and transitioned into becoming a real estate investment trust in 2013, only to revert back to corporate status in January 2021.\n\nAmong its most recent developments, CoreCivic was awarded a new contract in January for the housing of up to 2,706 adult male inmates on behalf of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation \u0026 Reentry at the company's 3,060-bed La Palma Correctional Center in Eloy, Arizona. Last September, CoreCivic signed a three-year lease agreement with the State of New Mexico at the company's 596-bed Northwest New Mexico Correctional Center while its contract with the U.S. Marshals Service for the 600-bed West Tennessee Detention Facility in Mason, Tennessee, expired. The inmates were transferred elsewhere and the company is marketing the facility to other government agencies.\nIn its latest earnings report, the fourth-quarter data published on Feb. 9, CoreCivic reported revenue of $472.1 million, down from $473.4 million one year earlier. The company’s total operating expenses of $332.9 million was down from $343.2 million in the previous year and its net income of $28 million was an improvement over the $26.8 million loss from 12 months earlier. The company ended the fourth quarter with 23-cent earnings per share — one year earlier, it recorded ...","keywords":["Long Ideas","News","REIT","Small Cap","Opinion","Top Stories","Trading Ideas","Real Estate"]},{"id":"WRKX5b4ET20-HFNTmtMPv2Anri-QD3w0T5U2p6NRT9I","publisher":{"name":"Zacks Investment Research","homepage_url":"https://www.zacks.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"},"title":"NIO, XPeng (XPEV), LI Auto (LI) Issue February Delivery Updates","author":"Zacks Equity Research","published_utc":"2022-03-02T16:04:00Z","article_url":"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1876149/nio-xpeng-xpev-li-auto-li-issue-february-delivery-updates","tickers":["TSLA","NIO","LI","XPEV"],"amp_url":"https://www.zacks.com/amp/stock/news/1876149/nio-xpeng-xpev-li-auto-li-issue-february-delivery-updates","image_url":"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/79/1382.jpg","description":"February 2022 deliveries of NIO, Li Auto (LI), XPENG's (XPEV) rise 9.9%, 265.8% and 180%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis."},{"id":"F1o-ryzEfnGFI6RLKgVAkyfsLvIA_9ujy3Vh5wrbxX0","publisher":{"name":"Zacks Investment Research","homepage_url":"https://www.zacks.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"},"title":"Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Sales Lag","author":"Zacks Equity Research","published_utc":"2022-03-02T16:04:00Z","article_url":"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1876139/dollar-tree-dltr-q4-earnings-beat-estimates-sales-lag","tickers":["DLTR","DKS","BOOT","WWW"],"amp_url":"https://www.zacks.com/amp/stock/news/1876139/dollar-tree-dltr-q4-earnings-beat-estimates-sales-lag","image_url":"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/9c/1199.jpg","description":"Dollar Tree (DLTR) gains from strong performances at its H2, Dollar Tree Plus and the new Combo Stores in Q4.

Benzinga Pro is a source for traders to see the latest news on the overall market and also on individual tickers.\nHere is a look at the stocks that were searched for most on Benzinga Pro for the month of February.\n1. SPDR S\u0026P 500 (NYSE: SPY)\n\nYTD Return: -8.1%\n52-Week Range: $371.88 to $479.88\nPrice: $436.63\n\nFor the second straight month, the S\u0026P 500 ETF was the most searched ticker on Benzinga Pro. The ETF was the eighth most-searched ticker in 2021 across Benzinga Pro.\nWith cycles of news stories of inflation, fed meetings and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the SPDR S\u0026P 500 remains one of the tickers on Benzinga Pro to get the latest macro news and themes.\n2.

Hemolysis refers to the destruction of red blood cells.\nPyrukynd is a \"new molecular entity,\" a term that refers to a drug containing an active moiety that hasn't been previously approved by the FDA. NME approval, therefore, is considered a measure of innovation in drug research.\nAnother NME that passed the FDA hurdle was Sanofi's (NASDAQ: SNY) Enjaymo for the treatment of hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease.\nReata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: RETA), as expected, received a complete response letter for its new drug application for bardoxolone methyl as a treatment option for Alport syndrome. An Adcom that met in early December  voted against recommending approval of the drug.\nPDUFA dates are key \"binary or make-or-break catalysts\" for biopharma companies.

Here are the key topics Biden highlighted in his address to the American people and Congress.\nThe Ukraine caucus on Capitol Hill encouraged members to wear blue and yellow ribbons for the President’s speech on Tuesday night. Some members could be seen in blue and yellow suits, ties and dresses.\nThe Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi introduced the President before the commencement of his address to the Congress. It was the first time in history that two women were seated behind the President. \nRussia-Ukraine Crisis: “Freedom will always triumph over tyranny,” said Biden. “Six days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways.
