invasion of Ukraine by Russia has brought worldwide attention to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nHere are five things you might not know about Zelensky.\n1. Elected In Landslide: Zelensky won Ukraine's 2019 presidential election, beating incumbent Petro Poroshenko. Zelensky won all but one voting region of the country and won 73.2% of the popular vote. The 2019 election saw a 62.1% voter turnout. For reference, the 2020 U.S. presidential election had 66.8% voter turnout. \n“I will never let you down,” Zelensky told supporters after his victory.\n2. Famous Actor Before Presidency: Prior to becoming the president of Ukraine, Zelensky was best known as an actor and comedian.

Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and PayPal Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) are all trading higher in strong uptrends. An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart.\nThe higher highs indicate the bulls are in control while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend with rising lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages), indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend and rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicating a long-term uptrend.\nA stock often signals when the higher high is in by printing a reversal candlestick such as a doji, bearish engulfing or hanging man candlestick. Likewise, the higher low could be signaled when a doji, morning star or hammer candlestick is printed. Moreover, the higher highs and higher lows often take place at resistance and support levels.\nIn an uptrend the \"trend is your friend\" until it’s not and in an uptrend there are ways for both bullish and bearish traders to participate in the stock:\n\nBullish traders who are already holding a ...","keywords":["Technicals","Top Stories","Movers","Trading Ideas"]},{"id":"HYasFz9q4AkTfS-OF32W8zxcjnJ8I12VaIguerpASuQ","publisher":{"name":"Benzinga","homepage_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"},"title":"What 12 Analyst Ratings Have To Say About Weave Communications","author":"Benzinga Insights","published_utc":"2022-03-03T18:03:16Z","article_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/22/03/25971352/what-12-analyst-ratings-have-to-say-about-weave-communications","tickers":["WEAV"],"amp_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/25971352","image_url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2022/analyst_ratings_image_4050.jpeg","description":"Analysts have provided the following ratings for Weave Communications (NYSE:WEAV) within the last quarter: \n\n\n\n\nBullish\nSomewhat Bullish\nIndifferent\nSomewhat Bearish\nBearish\n\n\n\n\nTotal Ratings\n7\n2\n3\n0\n0\n\n\nLast 30D\n1\n0\n2\n0\n0\n\n\n1M Ago\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2M Ago\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3M Ago\n6\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n\nThese 12 analysts have an average price target of $20.92 versus the current price of Weave Communications at $7.65, implying  upside.\nBelow is a summary of how these 12 analysts rated Weave Communications over the past 3 months.

The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.01%, down from last week’s 3.14%, and the five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage averaged 2.91%, down from last week when it averaged 2.98%.\nSam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, attributed the decline to Vladimir Putin.\n“Geopolitical tensions caused U.S. Treasury yields to recede this week as investors moved to the safety of bonds, leading to a drop in mortgage rates,” said Khater.\n“While inflationary pressures remain, the cascading impacts of the war in Ukraine have created market uncertainty. Consequently, rates are expected to stay low in the short-term but will likely increase in the coming months.”\nThe Home Price News: A new data report from Realtor.com, a division of the News Corp (NASDAQ: NWSA) subsidiary Move Inc., determined the U.S. median listing price increased 12.9% year-over-year to a new all-time high of $392,000; the previous peak of $385,000 occurred in July 2021.\nRealtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale observed that this was “the record has been broken in February, signaling that competition is already heating up weeks before ...","keywords":["News","Penny Stocks","Small Cap","Real Estate"]},{"id":"nZAehOuE4V6jNxUGaDdIt60NbV5EYrKsAsNj0MD1kg4","publisher":{"name":"Benzinga","homepage_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"},"title":"Where Pure Storage Stands With Analysts","author":"Benzinga Insights","published_utc":"2022-03-03T17:05:52Z","article_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/22/03/25969540/where-pure-storage-stands-with-analysts","tickers":["PSTG"],"amp_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/25969540","image_url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2022/analyst_ratings_image_4044.jpeg","description":"Within the last quarter, Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) has observed the following analyst ratings: \n\n\n\n\nBullish\nSomewhat Bullish\nIndifferent\nSomewhat Bearish\nBearish\n\n\n\n\nTotal Ratings\n3\n3\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nLast 30D\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1M Ago\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2M Ago\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3M Ago\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\nThese 6 analysts have an average price target of $38.67 versus the current price of Pure Storage at $30.995, implying  upside.\nBelow is a summary of how these 6 analysts rated Pure Storage over the past 3 months.

The Phase 3 study evaluated Acelarin plus cisplatin as a first-line treatment of advanced biliary tract cancer.\nAlthough a higher objective response rate was observed in the Acelarin plus cisplatin arm, this did not translate into an overall survival benefit, the company said.\nThe IDMC concluded that Acelarin plus cisplatin was unlikely to achieve its primary objective of demonstrating at least a 2.2-month improvement in overall survival as compared to the standard of care, gemcitabine plus cisplatin.
